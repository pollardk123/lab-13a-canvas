  I do not think I will use much animation on my website except for my main page.
  I still would like my name at the top of the page so just to add some character to it, I would like to attempt adding blue swirl circles
  Or if I can't accomplish that , I would add stars growing by size like the circles, or 3 stars in the shape of a dart board like the circles
  For the end of my page I think I will keep it simple, but I might need assistance since I have an idea of wanting to do a hand pointing to my contact information
  If I can't accomplish the hand , I would do a star  bouncing slowly on the page just because
